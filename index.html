    <p>I wanted to start by giving a brief description of my work here in Los Angeles.  In 2012 I took over management of the Lyric Theatre, a 300 capacity space on La Brea.  I transformed the space into a music and comedy venue that quickly became the most sought after venue of its size.  I have worked with Golden Voice, Live Nation, ASCAP, NIVA, and our roster included industry giants such as Quincy Jones, Allen Toussaint, and Sarah Silverman.  We were most noted for carving a pathway for young players in the industry such as Anderson Paak.  There I hoped to build a hybrid business, one that hosted seasoned performers while also providing fundraising opportunities to local educational platforms.  I developed an Arts for Autism program and the Lyric became a home to the countryâ€™s youngest Shakespeare troupe, The Los Angeles Drama Club. I currently sit on the advisory board of the Los Angeles High School of the Arts and was responsible for their only off-site fundraising efforts.  I have experience professionally as a performer, director, producer, and choreographer.</p>
